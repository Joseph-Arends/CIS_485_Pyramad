# CIS_485_Pyramad
Unity project I collaborated with for my video game design course at MNSU.
In this project, I was responsible for the puzzle room that involved working with platforming elements. I created multiple C# scripts to make sure moving platforms worked nicely with a player moving around.
The main scripts I worked on were CeilingDrop.cs, ElevatorGoDown.cs, PlatformMovement.cs, PlatformStick.cs, RotateObject.cs, TeleportPlayer.cs, WallBreaker.cs, UnlockThrowPower.cs, Elevator.cs.
